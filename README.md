## Identify knowledge in different levels

Our proposed method, namely **dimensionless learning**, is designed to identify and extract scientific insights and patterns from data without being influenced by the scale or size of the input. This enables us to uncover universal scientific knowledge at three different levels:

- **Dimensionless number** at the **feature level** (physical dimension reduction technique): 
  - **Example**: The Reynolds number, denoted as $\mathrm{Re}$, is a well-known dimensionless number that is often used to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. It is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid and is given by $\mathrm{Re}=\frac{\rho V l}{\mu}$, where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $V$ is the average flow velocity, $l$ is a characteristic length, and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The Reynolds number is interpretable because it represents the ratio of two forces, and it is universal because it is commonly used in fluid dynamics.
- **Scaling law** at the **algebraic equation level**
  - **Example**: The vapor depression dynamics in 3D printing is a complex process with many variables, but our approach allows us to represent it using a simple algebraic equation. Using our methodology, the vapor depression dynamics in 3D printing can be expressed as: $e^*=0.12\mathrm{Ke}-0.30$. This equation shows that the vapor depression dynamics can be described by a combination of two dimensionless numbers, $\mathrm{Ke}$ and $e^*$. The value of $e^*$ can be determined by the value of $\mathrm{Ke}$ using this equation, providing a concise and interpretable representation of the complex vapor depression dynamics in 3D printing.
- **Governing equation** at the **differential equation level**
  - **Example**: The well-known Navier-Stokes equation $\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial y}=\mathrm{\frac{1}{Re}}(\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial x^2} +\frac{\partial^2 \omega}{\partial y^2})$ can be identified from data by integrating dimensionless learning with SINDy. Note that in our approach, the coefficient used to describe a physical process or system will be a dimensionless number $\mathrm{Re}$ rather than a scalar that changes depending on the specific case. This means that the coefficient will not have any physical dimensions and will be invariant when the length, time, or energy scale of the system varies.

## Advantages

Our approach is not purely data-driven, but rather combines fundamental physics principles with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve scientific and engineering problems. By embedding the principle of dimensional invariance into a two-level machine learning scheme, our methodology is able to automatically discover dominant dimensionless numbers and governing laws from measurement data. This approach allows us to reduce high-dimensional parameter spaces and simplify complex processes, while still retaining a physically interpretable and accurate representation of the system. The detailed advantages are shown bwlow:

- **Dimension reduction**: 
  - Dimensionless leanring can reduce a large number of parameters to a few dominant dimensionless numbers.
- **Better interpretability**: 
  - The identified dimensionless can be interpreted as the ratio of different forces, velocities, or energies, etc.
  - Lower dimension also allow for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the systems of interest. 
- **Works well in small dataset**: 
  - By incorporating **fundamental physical knowledge** of dimensional invariance, the learning space is limited to a manageable size, which makes it possible to train well-performing models using scarce datasets.
- **Better generalization**:
  - Another benefit for embedding physical invariance is that the learned model have a better generalization in data with different materials and scales.
